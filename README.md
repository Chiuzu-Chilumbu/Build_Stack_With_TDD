# Build_Stack_With_TDD
Building the stack data structure using TDD &amp; BDD methodologies

---

"The `phase_one_red_green_refactor` branch is where the core principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) are put into practice to build the foundation of our stack implementation. In this phase, we are focused on the initial TDD cycle:

1. **Red:** Write comprehensive tests for the expected functionality of our stack, which will naturally fail on the first run as there is no corresponding implementation code yet.

2. **Green:** Develop the minimal amount of code necessary to pass the written tests. The focus here is not on perfection but rather on meeting the specifications laid out by our tests.

3. **Refactor:** With passing tests, we enter the refactoring stage. Here, we improve the structure and efficiency of our code without altering its external behavior. Pylint, a Python linter, is employed to ensure that our code adheres to the stylistic guidelines and best practices.

In addition to TDD, we are also integrating BDD principles by using `pytest_bdd` along with feature files. These feature files are written in Gherkin language, which allows us to define our expected software behavior in a readable and understandable format. The scenarios defined in the feature files drive our testing, ensuring that our implementation aligns with the desired behavior.

By the end of this branch, we aim to have a fully tested stack that behaves as expected and is clean, well-structured, and maintainable. The `phase_one_red_green_refactor` branch is crucial for establishing high code quality and robustness from the outset of our project."
