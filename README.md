# Build_Stack_With_TDD
Building the stack data structure using TDD &amp; BDD methodologies

---

"In the `file_structure` branch, we meticulously organize the project's files and directories to establish a solid foundation for development. The structure is designed to separate concerns, enhance maintainability, and facilitate easy navigation for developers.

Key components of the file structure include:

- **Root Directory (`STACK`):**
  - `.pytest_cache`: A directory used by Pytest to store information about the tests that have been run, which helps in optimizing the test suite execution.
  - `Build_Stack_With_TDD`: This directory encapsulates the entire stack development process following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.
    - `.pytest_cache`: Similar to the root `.pytest_cache`, it stores test-related data specific to the TDD process.
    - `data`: Intended to hold various data files or scripts related to the stack implementation, although currently, it's not populated with user files.
    - `tests`: Contains all the test cases and feature files for BDD testing.
      - `__pycache__`: A directory generated by Python that stores byte-compiled code to speed up module loading.
      - `features`: Houses the Gherkin feature files, such as `create_stack.feature`, which define the expected behavior of the stack in a human-readable format.
      - `test_stack_bdd.py`: The Python test file that uses the `pytest_bdd` framework to test the behaviors described in the `.feature` files.
      - `test_stack.py`: A Python test file for unit testing the stack implementation.
  - `README.md`: A Markdown file that provides an overview of the project, including instructions for setup, testing, and usage examples.
  - `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`: Used by the `pipenv` tool to manage project dependencies, ensuring consistent installations across environments.

This branch ensures that all necessary directories and files are appropriately placed and that the project's structure adheres to Python's best practices. As development progresses, the structure can be scaled or modified to accommodate new components or modules."
