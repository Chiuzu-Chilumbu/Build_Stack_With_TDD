# Final Phase: Style Conformance with Pylint

## Phase Five: Ensuring Code Excellence

The `final_phase_style_lints` branch marks the culmination of our development process, focusing on enforcing style guidelines and code quality using `pylint`. This step underscores our commitment to maintaining a codebase that is not only functional but also clean, readable, and maintainable according to the highest standards of Python coding practices.

### Style and Linting

During this phase, we've integrated `pylint` into our workflow to systematically evaluate our code for potential errors, enforce a consistent coding style, and encourage best practices. This process has involved:

- Analyzing our existing codebase with `pylint`, identifying areas for improvement.
- Refining code to adhere to the recommendations provided by `pylint`.
- Setting up a linting step in our continuous integration pipeline to ensure that all future contributions meet the style requirements.

### How to Run Pylint

To run `pylint` on the stack code and check for style and quality issues, use the following command from the root directory of the project:

```bash
pylint stack_adt
```

This command will output a report detailing the linting score and any suggestions for code improvement.

### Final Codebase

With the completion of this phase, the `main` branch now contains a fully implemented Stack ADT with comprehensive tests and a codebase polished to meet style guidelines. The stack is ready for production use and further development.

### Contributions

We welcome contributions that help improve the codebase and extend the functionality of the stack. We ask that all contributions:

- Include tests that pass the existing suite.
- Adhere to our coding and style standards, as verified by `pylint`.
- Are accompanied by appropriate documentation updates.

### Moving Forward

As we merge this final phase into the `main` branch, we close the initial development cycle of our Stack ADT. Yet, the journey of improvement and adaptation continues.
